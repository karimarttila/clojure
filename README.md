# Clojure Repository

## Introduction

These are my miscellaneous Clojure exercises. I have mostly done these exercises to learn some new Clojure technologies. These exercises are one-shot exercises and I do not maintain any of these exercises once they are done. These exercises are not meant to be templates or examples for others. If you still want to use these exercises as an example, you are on your own if you run into any issues.
